# Background

Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of **Wikipedia articles**, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.


From the official text, we know there are **mainly 2 types of answers**:

1. span answer
2. Not given by passage


# What's next

Let's dive into the dataset, and we can easily find that we have different types of questions:

# Missing Information I want to recover

## Richer information
Some answers actually can contain richer numberic answer, but some also cant:

    "question":       "What was the monetary base value in 1994?",

# Trying to translate to Chinese

Using Google Translate (transforming the text into HTML with answer spans enclosed with a <span id="xxx">), I get a copy of SQuAD in Chinese. For sure, it contains quite a lot of non-senses:

## Answer span shifted

```python
{
    "id":               "56d1196917492d1400aab93f",
    "question_orig":    "What industry is Broadway associated with?",
    "answer_text_orig": "the theater",
    "question":         "百老匯與哪個行業有關？",
    "answer_text":      "是劇院",
                        # should be "劇院"
}
    
```

```python
{
    "id":               "56cf3e29aab44d1400b88ed4",
    "question_orig":    "Quantum is a division of what other organization? ",
    "answer_text_orig": "Spectre",
    "question":         "昆騰是其他哪個組織的部門？",
    "answer_text":      "幽靈》還是",
                        # should be "幽靈"
}
```

```python
{
    "id":               "56df322e96943c1400a5d2d5",
    "question_orig":    "When did the term Nasara become used more in modern times?",
    "answer_text_orig": "July 2014",
    "question":         "納薩拉（Nasara）一詞何時在現代得到更多使用？",
    "answer_text":      "2014",
                        # should be "2014年7月"
}
```

Why here? :(

```python
{
    "id":               "56e42e3739bdeb1400347920",
    "question_orig":    "From what other country's orthography did the Older Orthography get its basis?",
    "answer_text_orig": "standard German orthography",
    "question":         "舊式拼字法是從哪個其他國家的拼字法獲得的依據？",
    "answer_text":      "拼字法是",
                        # should be "標準的德國拼字法"
}
```



## Incorrect Translation
Not enough information for Google translate to infer the correct translation

```python
{
    "id":          "573403a24776f419006616ef",
    "context":     "The fairs held at the shrines of Sufi saints are called urs. ...",
    "question":    "What are urs?",
    "question-zh": "什麼是我們的？",
}
```

Google is trying to be smart though XD



## Tailored Questions in English


```python
{
    "id":          "57344d20acc1501500babdd2",
    "question":    "What does the Indian word \"shikaris\" mean in English?",
    "answer_text": "big-game hunters",
}
```

## Chinese just do not speak like English since we are not mapping word to word

```python
    "id":               "56d23d72b329da140004ec4c",
    "context":          "Regarding the monastic rules, the Buddha constantly reminds his hearers that it is the spirit that counts. ...",
    "question":         "佛陀提醒他的聽眾，那是什麼精神？",
    "question_orig":    "the Buddha reminds his hearers that it is the spirit that what?",
    "answer_text_orig": "counts",
}

```
